# README Work In Progress

Hi, I am Nouman Malik

Here are a few quick things about me:
- I am graduating from the University of Windsor with a degree in Comp Sci
- Did at internship at the University as a Web Developer
- Even though my experience is as a web developer, I really enjoy making algorithm based solutions for problems in C++
- I also don't want to be a web developer forever. I like challenges, but not in the form of "Why isn't this div centering??"
- I might be addicted to iced coffee
- My favorite thing to do is get excited about an idea, make 5% of it and then get bored and move onto something else [^1]

[^1]: If it wasn't obvious I am being sarcastic here lol

## Actually Useful Things I Made
- [Eloqua Automatic Login](https://github.com/NoumanAMalik/Eloqua-Automatic-Login-Extension):
  - This is a Chrome Browser Extension that automatically signs you into your Oracle Eloqua Account through SSO
  - I made this because at the University of Windsor, we use Oracle Eloqua for Landing Pages, and every time I want to sign in, I need to type out UniversityOfWindsor and click the submit button
  - This is very tedious, so instead, this extension uses cutting edge AI technology to do it for me
  - lol just kidding, no AI here, I just simply grab the input from its id and set the input's value equal to my company name
  - Then I grab the submit button, again from its id, and click it
